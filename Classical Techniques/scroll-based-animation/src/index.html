        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Natnael Badigo, a software engineering student who's
          fallen in love with 3D web development. I’ve been diving into Three.js
          lately, and it’s been an exciting ride turning ideas into interactive
          visuals. This portfolio is a little glimpse into what I’ve been up
          to—hope you enjoy!

        <h2>My Creative Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been building some fun projects every week to apply what I’ve
          learned in Three.js, from 3D scenes to practical web apps. It’s all
          about experimenting, learning, and creating things that look cool and
          work well. Take a look around and let me know what you think—I’m
          always open to feedback or just geeking out about code!

          Got questions? Ideas? Or maybe you’re working on something awesome and
          want to chat? Hit me up! I’m always happy to connect with other
          developers, designers, or anyone who shares a passion for building
